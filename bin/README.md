# bin
This is the `bin` directory for this repository.
This directory should be included on the shell's path ONLY when this repository is activated as the current project.
This directory tends to contain mostly BASH scripts, though I am leaning more towards using Python for simple scripts.
These scripts are designed to be invoked directly by the user in the shell.
Therefore, these scripts should have proper shebangs and proper file permissions to make them executable as intended in the user's shell.
This directory should have a `lib` subdirectory for holding supporting scripts that are used by these scripts.
