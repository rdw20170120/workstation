# Notes on project initiation
These notes describe how Rob first initiated this project
by preparing his development workstation
and creating this source repository.
Rob based his approach on his pre-existing open-source project BriteOnyx,
which is likewise based on his many years of technical experience.

## Install tools
* Using Apple MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)

## Prepare project directory
1. [Setup source control including cloning the repository][clone].
1. Copy in various files from Rob's previous BriteOnyx project

## Create a project-specific Python virtual environment
[Activate this project in a shell][activate].

~~~ bash
pve-create
source $BO\_PVE/bin/activate
pip3 install wheel
dep-capture
tool-capture
exit
~~~

Create [activate.bash](../activate.bash) to source `$BO_PVE/bin/activate`.
