# `bin` directory
This is the `BriteOnyx/bin` directory for this repository.
This directory should be included on the shell's `PATH` only when this repository is activated as the current project.
This directory tends to contain mostly Bash and Python scripts.
These scripts are designed to be invoked directly by the user in the shell.
Therefore, these scripts should have proper shebangs and proper file permissions to make them executable as intended.
This directory should have a `lib` subdirectory for holding supporting scripts that are used by these scripts.
