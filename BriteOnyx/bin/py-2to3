# NOTE: Apparently, it is not possible to run Python3 code exclusively with the
# .py3 file extension, so do not add a '3' suffix to the source files.

# NOTE: The 2to3 tool throws a parsing error sometimes, which requires careful
# effort to hunt down and fix manually in the Python2 code.

# Therefore, I STRONGLY recommend that one works through this conversion
# process incrementally.
#  1.  Ensure that you are starting with a clean checkout from the source
#      control repository.  If anything goes wrong in the following
#      steps, you can revert back.
#  2.  Start by disabling (commenting out) writing back to the source files.
#  3.  Disable the 'all' transformation.
#  4.  Enable the '-p' print function transformation.
#  5.  Disable all optional fix transformations.
#  6.  Look at the command output for problems, hunt them down in the Python2
#      source files, and fix them.  Continue until the output is clean.  In
#      particular, fix any 'ParseError's that arise.  It appears that only this
#      transformation produces a ParseError.
#  7.  Enable write back to the source files.
#  8.  Save the conversions to the source files.  I suggest commiting these
#      file changes before proceeding.
#  9.  Disable writing back to the source files again.
# 10.  Enable the 'all' transformation.
# 11.  Disable the '-p' print function transformation.
# 12.  Disable all optional fix transformations.
# 13.  Look at the command output for problems, hunt them down in the Python2
#      source files, and fix them.  Continue until the output is clean.  In
#      particular, fix any 'ParseError's that arise.
# 14.  Disable the 'all' transformation.
# 15.  Disable the '-p' print function transformation.
# 16.  One by one, enable the optional fix transformations.
# 17.  Look at the command output for problems, hunt them down in the Python2
#      source files, and fix them.  Continue until the output is clean.
# 18.  Enable write back to the source files.
# 19.  Save the conversions to the source files.  I suggest commiting these
#      file changes too.
# 20.  When the process is done, leave this script as you found it: writing
#      back should be disabled, while ONLY the 'all' transformation should be
#      enabled.
