# Set PATH for project
#
# NOTE: This specific ordering of PATH elements is REQUIRED.
# The Anaconda environment MUST come first
# in order to override everything else.
# The system PATH element MUST precede any user PATH elements
# in order to make collisions fail-fast
# and
# to defeat simple attempts
# at redirecting system commands
# as an attack vector.
# Similarly,
# the project PATH element MUST precede the user PATH element
# in order to make collisions fail-fast.
# This arrangement is best
# for ensuring consistent behavior
# of the environment, the system, and the project.
# It puts at-risk
# only those user-specific commands, tools, and scripts
# relevant to the current deployed environment--
# where the specific user is best positioned to address them
# and failures are most likely limited
# to affecting only 
# the current project and user
# (as they should).
