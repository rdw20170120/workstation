# workstation
This is content for my development workstations, of which I tend to have many.
For each one, there are customizations of course.
But I desire some similarity, so that I can work effectively and efficiently.

I strongly prefer to use an Apple MacBook Pro as my laptop, running the latest
macOS.
I have used laptops running Microsoft Windows for most of my career, and
running Ubuntu in the recent past, but I find that macOS is the best operating
system for getting the most out of the best available (e.g., Apple) hardware.
I currently have two MacBook Pros personally, and I have another one belonging
to my primary client.

I tend to work within a virtual machine (VM) much of the time, so that my
development environment is isolated from my other machine environments.
On my personal development laptop I run VMware Fusion, in which I run a Linux
Mint VM.
I strongly prefer using Ubuntu, though my clients often have me working on RHEL
and CentOS.
I am considering moving my development to a workstation environment based on
recent Debian releases.
However, I strongly prefer Ubuntu LTS for server environments.
So, I will probably stay with an Ubuntu workstation too.
I love NixOS, but I have not done anything with it in quite a while; I need to
explore that again.
