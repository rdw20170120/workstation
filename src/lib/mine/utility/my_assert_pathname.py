"""My module for assertions.

The Python `assert` statement takes an optional message argument,
but it has to be specified on each statement.
When the message argument is absent
then the resulting AssertionError
has an empty message that completely fails to communicate.
I want messages on EVERY assertion
that consistently match the assertion logic,
so I chose to refactor the assertions implementation.
However, it appears that I cannot return both
the conditional logic test result (bool) and
the failed assertion message (str)
from the call to a single helper function.

Therefore, I have refactored
to a set of helper functions
that return `True`
when the assertion condition logic succeeds
and throw a custom AssertionError
with a good consistent message
when the assertion condition logic fails.

This preserves the observable behavior of the `assert` statements.
Since the `assert` statements
become a no-op during an optimized compilation,
all of these helper functions can still be optimized away.
