# TODO items for this project repository
These are outstanding items of work for us to do.
Each item should be annotated to facilitate prioritization.
Annotations should be specified as low (L), medium (M), or high (H)
for the importance (I) and the urgency (U) of each item.
Prioritizing can be accomplished by physically reordering the items in the list.
Obviously, items with higher importance and/or higher urgency should be prioritized for earlier implementation.
Of course, ordering should also respect dependencies between items, when relevant.

Items should be checked-off and perhaps moved to the bottom when completed.
Items should be struck-out to indicate that they have been canceled, unless they should merely be deleted.
