# TODO items for this project
These are outstanding items of work
for us to do.
Each item
should be given a category for grouping.
This list
is intended to be kept short and simple enough
that it can be
visually scanned and managed.

Items should be checked-off
and perhaps moved to the bottom
when completed.
Items should be struck-out
to indicate that they have been canceled,
unless they should merely be deleted.
