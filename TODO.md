TODO items for this project
===========================
These are outstanding items to do for this project.  Prioritizing can be
accomplished by physically reordering the items in the list.  Each item should
be annotated to facilitate prioritization.  Annotations should be specified as
low (L), medium (M), or high (H) for the importance (I) and the urgency (U) of
each item.  Obviously (I hope), items with higher importance and/or higher
urgency should be prioritized for earlier implementation.  Of course, ordering
should also respect dependencies between items.

Items should be struck-out and moved to the bottom when completed.
