# TODO items for this project
These are outstanding items of work for us to do.
Each item should be annotated to facilitate prioritization.
Annotations should be specified
as 1 (highest) to 3 (or more, lowest)
for the importance (I) and the urgency (U) of each item.
Prioritizing can be accomplished
by physically reordering the items in the list.
Obviously, items with higher importance and/or higher urgency
should be prioritized for earlier implementation.
Of course,
ordering should also respect dependencies between items,
when relevant.

Items should be checked-off
and perhaps moved to the bottom
when completed.
Items should be struck-out
to indicate that they have been canceled,
unless they should merely be deleted.

## Notes
### iTerm2 color palettes
These Solarized color palettes are very effective.
So copy them to other terminals,
such as in Linux Mint.
