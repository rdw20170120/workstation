TODO items for this project
===========================
These are outstanding items to do for this project.
Prioritizing can be accomplished by physically reordering the items in the
list.
Each item should be annotated to facilitate prioritization.
Annotations should be specified as low (L), medium (M), or high (H) for the
importance (I) and the urgency (U) of each item.
Obviously (I hope), items with higher importance and/or higher urgency should
be prioritized for earlier implementation.
Of course, ordering should also respect dependencies between items.

Items should be struck-out and moved to the bottom when completed.
