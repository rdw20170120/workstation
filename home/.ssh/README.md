# `.ssh`
This is content intended for the `.ssh` directory within my user home directory
on my workstations.
Naturally, I would never put secrets such as SSH private keys into a source
control repository.
However, it is useful to share SSH `config` files and other configuration that
makes using SSH more convenient.
