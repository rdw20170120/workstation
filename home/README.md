# home
This directory holds content intended for my user home directory on my
workstations.
So this is where my user login scripts belong, as well as other content to
support my work on each workstation.
Notice that there exist subdirectories for various operating systems such as
macOS and Ubuntu.
The content within those subdirectories are targeted for deployment into home
directories hosted on the corresponding OS.
The rest of the content within this `home` directory, that is not under one of
the OS-specific subdirectories, is intended to be cross-platform and therefore
suitable for all of the supported OS platforms.
In some cases, that may mean that scripts may require logic to act
appropriately on each OS platform.
