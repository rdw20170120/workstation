# as a means to update
# with your latest edits.

# This is a sample.
# It is intended
# to be copied to
# `${BO_Project}/context.bash`.
# The `activate.bash` script
# does this if it is missing
# (e.g.,
# when first executed after
# `git clone`
# )
# so that BriteOnyx activation
# is satisfied.

# NOTE: `${BO_Project}/context.bash`

# do NOT commit

# to source control.

# See the various `config.py`
